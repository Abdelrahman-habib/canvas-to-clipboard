# Chrome extension "Canvas downloader. Find and export."  
Available at [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-detect-and-downloa/dgfcgcafnnbdpojemnkiiilnnghebgja)  
Extension helps detect if canvas is used at the web page and allows to export and download canvas content in multiple formats.  
Extension could be helpful if creator of the web site disabled the canvas context menu with "Save As" option.  
You could see the counter with the number of detected canvas elements in the extension icon, if any canvas detected.  
Sometimes the counter at the icon could be different from the real amount of available canvas elements, because of the security concerns like "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" policies applied to source images.
